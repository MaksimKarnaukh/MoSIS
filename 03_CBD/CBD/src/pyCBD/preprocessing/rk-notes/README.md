# rk-notes
This folder contains helper information that can be used to explain the
Runge-Kutta algorithm. While it can all be removed from the repo, it is
kept for future reference. Unless there is an interest/requirement to
know the internal workings of this code, you can ignore all files.

The files in this directory are:

* `RKF.m`: Matlab module that implements RKF.
* `rkf.py`: Pure Python version of the RKF logic.
* `rungekutta-visual.drawio`: Visual representation to show how the models
    need to be transformed in order to do RKF.
* `2021-04-12-Note-17-27.xopp` and `2021-04-15-Note-15-46.xopp`: Notes from
    meetings about the exact functionality/logic behind RKF.
