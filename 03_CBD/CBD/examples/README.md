# examples
This folder contains all the examples that are mentioned in the documentation in
twofold. In the `scripts` folder, you will find all Python scripts of the code
itself. These can be easily executed from anywhere. The `notebook` folder contains
all examples, but in a Jupyter notebook. They are the interactive version of the
documentation.

The `scripts` folder contains a set of folders, each having multiple files.
The `*.xml` file is a visual representation of the CBD model, created with
Draw.IO. The Python files are the generated version. Each `*_experiment.py` 
file is the experiment file  that needs to be executed in order to execute
the example.
