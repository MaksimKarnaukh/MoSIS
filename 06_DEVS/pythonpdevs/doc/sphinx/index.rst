PythonPDEVS documentation
=========================

The Interface section contains all information about the functions and methods that should be used by the modeller. Internal documentation shows the complete interface that is only supposed to be used by the simulator itself.

.. warning:: Only the methods mentioned in the Interface subsection should be used by the user, all others can have unexpected side effects due to the use of Time-Warp!
