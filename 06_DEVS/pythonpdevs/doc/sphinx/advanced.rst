Advanced examples
=================

In this section, we will continue using the model from the previous section wherever possible. We will extend it in several ways, each demonstrating another feature of the PyPDEVS simulator that will first be briefly explained. All examples are sorted based on complexity of both usage and implementation, but also with dependencies in mind.
